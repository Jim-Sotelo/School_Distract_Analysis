# School_Distract_Analysis

#findings

#Through the data it looks like the Charter schools have a better math score than the public school until their senior year

#even though the Charter schools receive less money for their budget overall they seem to be preparing their students better

#would be interesting to check other scores and see if seniors in the public schools are overall getting better average scores

#please note that the file given did not have any student counts in it so was unable to compare the size of schools to see

#if maybe a smaller school has a better avgerage test score.
